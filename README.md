This app allows you to filter "Characters", "Episodes" or "Locations" of the popular tv show "Rick and Morty"<br />

If you want to see results, you must enter a minimum of 3 characters, for example, "ric" shows you results for the three filters, and the "Load more" button, pick more results and show they on the screen (if they pass the filter)<br />

With the "reset" button, you clean the input text and hide all the results.<br />
